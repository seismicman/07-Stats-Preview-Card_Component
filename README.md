## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Although this is a project that mainly we can develop in HTML and CSS, I developed it in React as an unique component and CSS for the styles. The most important part was how do we overlay a background image in CSS. Also, it was very useful to understand Flexbox to organize the different components of the User Interface and the use of media queries to switch between desktop and mobile versions.

### Continued development

I would like to continue developing this challenges using React as main resource and complementing with other ones as HTML5, CSS, SAAS, among others
